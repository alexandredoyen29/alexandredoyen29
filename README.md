Hi ! I am Alexandre DOYEN, a Ph.D. student in the Binsec team, of the CEA-List at Palaiseau (France) ([Team website](https://binsec.github.io/)).
My work is focussed on fuzzing network protocols to try to find backdoors.
I mainly develop in C, C++, and recently, OCaml.

Here is my [personal website](https://alexandredoyen29.github.io/en/) (Available in French and in English).
